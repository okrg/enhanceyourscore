<h4>How it works</h4>
We’ve developed our affiliate program to function as an extension of the service you already provide to your clients.  This means, we essentially service as a supplier for your tradeline needs, and your clients do not even know we exist.  When your client needs a tradeline, you simply order it from us and we add the client to the tradeline purchased.

<h4>Pricing </h4>
We offer affiliates a flat rate of $500.00 per tradeline.  This means, out of the 100+ tradelines available, you will never pay more than $500.00 per tradeline.  If it is a $5,000.00 tradeline with 2 years of history, it costs you $500.00.  If it is a $47,000.00 tradeline with 15 years of history, it costs you $500.00.  Not only is this a drastic savings compared to retail prices, but this pricing model leaves you the flexibility to up-charge your clients and make a profit with what amounts to a few minutes of work for you.

<h4>Analysis</h4>
 It is important to select an appropriate tradeline for your client so that they receive the maximum impact to their credit scores.  Thorough analysis and reasonable and appropriate tradeline selection is a must.  We assist you with and train you on the tradeline selection process and client credit report analysis.

<h4>Free referrals </h4>
As stated on our website, “We sell and specialize in seasoned tradelines and authorized user tradelines, which is our niche market and our specialization.  This means, we do not conduct credit repair of any kind.   Approximately 30% of the potential clients that contact us for tradelines are not qualified due to the amount of derogatory items in their credit report.  We provide them with counseling and direction in finding an appropriate credit repair company for their needs and don’t ask for a penny in referral fees.

<h4>Trust </h4>
Accounting During the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, the funds are maintained in a trust account as regulated by the New York Dept. of Corporations and protected by our $100,000.00 surety bond. 

<h4>Reliable and Trustworthy </h4>
If you do a search on the internet, you will not find a single complaint about us.  This is a result of our ability to deliver on our promises and resolve any issues that come along professionally and promptly.  With over 100 affiliate relationships established and thousands of clients served, this is a true testament to our dedication to excellence. 

All clients must have a social security number, and must not have any other number linked to their name, including an additional social security number, credit profile number, credit privacy number, etc., or any number aside from their social security number reporting to the three major credit bureaus.

Clients must be clear of security freezes, fraud alerts, etc., prior to adding tradelines to their file.  Otherwise, you void the provision of our refund policy.
