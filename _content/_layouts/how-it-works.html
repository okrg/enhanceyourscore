									<div class="intro">Enhance Your Score extends credit to you from a network of business and personal credit lines with a long and perfect payment history. Our experts have made it easy to build and enhance your credit rating using combination of processes and techniques known as piggy backing.</div>
									
									<div class="featured-box simpleborder" style="margin-left:0;background:#fcfcfa; width:auto;padding:20px;">
										<div class="fancyb" style="width:auto;">

											<span style="font-size: 18px;">About Credit Piggy Backing</span>
										</p>

									<img src="/assets/piggybacking.jpg"  style="width:30%;float:right;margin:10px;" />

									<p style="color:#333;">Enhance Your Score has created a process and system to implement the practice, sometimes called piggybacking, which uses a creditworthy borrower's accounts to improve the credit rating of an unrelated third party.</p>
									
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									
									<p style="color:#333;">The creditworthy borrower adds the third party as an <strong>authorized user</strong> of his lines of credit, but does not actually provide the third party with materials (credit cards, account numbers, etc.) that would permit the third party to make charges against that account.</p>
									</div>
									</div>										
									

									<p>&nbsp;</p>

									<p>The benefit to the third party is an improvement in their personal credit rating—their credit score increases. However, this does not change their entire credit record, but merely increases their credit score as a result of the newly added tradeline. This may make the third party look like a better credit risk, and may improve the third party's access to new credit. However, a credit score is only one aspect of the lending process; that is, the borrower must pass all underwriting procedures, which include much more than the credit scores of the borrower.</p>

								
								</div>
								
								<div class="eight columns">


									<h5>What is an Authorized User?</h5>
									<p>An authorized user is someone that has the ability to use the account, but not make any changes to it or the responsibility to repay balances owed. The original intent of the AU position was to give cardholders the ability to add their children, spouses, or employees to their accounts so they could have access to the available credit line.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>A coincidental benefit occurs during this process whereby the account history for that credit card appears on the AU's credit report and it looks like it has been there since the account was first opened, which gives them a FICO® credit score BOOST. While the AU does not receive the physical card or account number during this process, they will receive the amazing benefit of having that particular credit card's entire credit payment history, limit, and balance transferred on to their credit report.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>This extreme increase in the limit to balance ratio on your report gives you the biggest possible BOOST to your credit in less than 60 days, guaranteed!</p>	
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<h5>What is a Seasoned Tradeline?</h5>
									<p>These are established lines of credit with payment history of multiple years showing on time payments and low balance ratios. Over time a line of credit becomes seasoned with excellent reporting history due to good credit practices, such as paying balances down regularly and never missing a payment.</p>

								<h3>Trade Line Effects on Business Credit Ratings</h3>
								<div class="eight columns">		
									<p>Business credit is much like your own personal credit score – it’s a proxy for your business’ ability to repay its debts. When you start a business, this type of credit may not be at the top of your agenda. But as you plan to expand and grow, establishing good business credit will be helpful if you decide to apply for a business loan.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>Business credit, also known as trade credit, is the single largest source of lending and is monitored by business credit bureaus. These bureaus gather data on trade credit transactions and produce business credit reports for the benefit of credit issuers. Credit is measured on a scale of 0-100, with a score of 75 or more being the ideal range.</p>

									<img src="/assets/business_logos.gif"  style="width:80%;display:block;margin:20px auto;" />

									<p>One of the most popular credit rating companies,Dun &amp; Bradstreet, has a vast database of credit profiles on millions of companies--it is probably the most often referred-to organization when it comes to seeking business or corporate credit ratings.  The next most popular is Equifax Small Business Credit Risk Score that intends to predict delinquency on financial accounts, and is designed for the financial services industry. This score is numeric, between 101 and 992, with a lower score denoting a greater risk of delinquency. </p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>Our Business Credit Enhance program implements credit trade line techniques which get reported back to D&amp;B and Experian reporting services.</p>

									<h5>Why is it Important to Build Credit as a Business?</h5>
									<div class="check">To Fully Protect your Personal Credit
									<p>With corporate credit, your business debts and financial obligations would be reported only on your company’s credit reports—not on your personal reports. As a result, your personal debt to credit limit ratio would not be impacted by the debts of your company.</p>
									<p>
										<a href="/understanding-business-credit" class="button small yellow">
											<span>Understanding Business Credit &raquo;</span>
										</a>
									</p>
									</div>
									

									<div class="check">Protect the corporate identify and Limit personal liability
									<p>By separating personal and business credit, you eliminate the risk of commingling funds – and this includes the commingling of credit. By building a creditworthy company, creditors and lenders will be less likely to require a personal guarantee to secure financing.</p>
									<p>
										<a href="/separate-credit-report-for-your-business" class="button small yellow">
											<span>Separating Business Credit from Personal Credit &raquo;</span>
										</a>
									</p>
									</div>

									<div class="check">Conserve cash flow
									<p>Many suppliers, businesses, and vendors will extend credit to your business with net 30-day to 60-day terms. This allows you to conserve cash while obtaining the products and services your business needs.</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="check">Receive larger credit limits
									<p>You can obtain 10 to 100 times greater credit limits from lenders as an established creditworthy business than you can as an individual.</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="check">SAVE MONEY!
									<p>Businesses obtain more favorable rates on lines of credit compared to an individual. For example, you may pay up to 13% interest on a $100,000 line of credit whereas a business could qualify for an interest rate of 7%. That would save you almost $40,000 in interest alone.</p>

								<h3>Trade Line Effects on Personal Credit Scores</h3>
								<div class="eight columns">		
									
									<p>Your credit history is not changed, but the presense of new lines of credit on your credit report will add to the overall credit score.</p>

									<img src="/assets/credit-calc.jpg"  style="width:60%;display:block;margin:40px auto;" />

									
									<p>There is no difference between adding an authorized user tradeline and opening a new account; they both affect your credit score. Federal law, specifically the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, provides for the addition of authorized user tradeline, without regard for the relationship between the parties. This means you are entitled to obtain the benefits of this program.</p>

								<h5>Superior Credit Wins You Favorable Loan Terms</h5>
									<p>Your credit rating is one of the key factors that lenders take into consideration when finding lending packages that may include discounts depending on your credit rating and risk levels. Consumers with low credit scores end up paying higher interest fees over time. </p>
