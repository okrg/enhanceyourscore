As your business applies for and receives credit with suppliers and business lenders, a business credit report will be established and the financial obligations of the business will report separately from your personal credit history.

Your business and personal credit scores are not directly linked but they can be related if you secure business credit with a personal guarantee. Over 50% of all small businesses use some form of personal credit to finance their business, and lenders use this information to try to determine the risk of borrowers. 

In situations where an entrpreneur using personal financing to start a business,  having poor personal credit history associated with your business credit report can have a terrible effect on your ability to get loan approvals or lines of credit with suppliers, wholesalers, and other financial institutions.

As your business grows, separating the business from your personal credit can help you reduce the credit history risk associated with the business. 

With corporate credit, your business debts and financial obligations would be reported only on your company’s credit reports—not on your personal reports. As a result, your personal debt to credit limit ratio would not be impacted by the debts of your company.

<h4>How to Start</h4>
To separate your personal credit history from your business credit you must first establish your business as a legal entity that does not hold you personally liable for the debts of the business. 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) allows lenders, under certain circumstances, to review personal credit histories for business lending purposes. This only applies to businesses that are structured as “sole proprietorships.”

There are number of ways to incorporate or structure a small business so that you can obtain the advantages of a business credit history.  [Please contact us](/contact-us) to get  in touch with an expert advisor who can walk you through the process.
